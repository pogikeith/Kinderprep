                This was my daughter's first year with KinderPrep preschool.  She had attended another preschool previously and did not respond well, 
                so I was slightly skeptical about how she would react to KinderPrep.  I am pleased to share that my child has flourished under the 
                teacher, Amber Slentz's care.  Amber has reinforced all of the basic skills like number and letter recall, but she also has done far more 
                in the teaching of my child than just the "basics".  Through Kinderprep and the teaching of Amber Slentz, my child has a keen interest in 
                why volcanoes erupt, what planets exist in our galaxy, where did the dinosaurs go, and what she wants to be in the future- a scientist! 
                Best of all, my child, who before would hate to talk about reading and writing and letter recall, can actually read short sentences now 
                due to what she has learned in Amber's class! Amber Slentz is devoted in every sense of the word to educating the whole child.  
                For that, I am very grateful. <br/> <br/>Anong R.

                My son Tommy went to Kinderprep Preschool for the 2008- 2009 school year.  He has learned to count and is now even adding small numbers.  
                He knows all the letters and their sounds,  He has begun to try to sound out words and even spell words and he's only 4!  The thing he 
                likes most about Kinderprep is the awesome projects they do.  He learned about the skeletons in our body, how to grow crystals and dig 
                for dinosaur bones.  There are frequent parties and field trips too. Kinderprep is one of the most academic preschools I have known and 
                I have been involved in many different preschools between my 4 kids. <br/> <br/> Carly P.

                My twin girls started KinderPrep last year when they were 3 1/2 years old.  I was hesitant at first as I wasn't sure how an in-home 
                preschool would operate.  I was quite impressed with the set up at KinderPrep when I first visited.  Each child has their own cubbie and 
                basket.  The room is large and has designated areas for work, play, and reading.  The walls are decorated just like a classroom.  I was 
                also impressed by the curriculum.  My girls have learned so much and I know they will be well-prepared for Kindergarten.  But what was 
                most important to me was that they have learned how to behave at school, interact and have fun with classmates, and be good students.  I 
                have KinderPrep Preschool and Mrs. Amber to thank for this.<br/> <br/>Diana C.

                My son has been going to KinderPrep since we moved here April of 2007 when he was just 2 ½ . He loves going to school and is learning so 
                much. I have already seen such a change academically in him since school began in August. He is writing his letters both upper and lower. 
                I met with a Kindergarten teacher recently and from the information I was given, he will be starting school with the right skills needed 
                to succeed, all of which I credit Amber. I am thankful for Amber and KinderPrep and that my son was able to attend these past 2 years.<br/><br/>

                The KinderPrep Preschool program is great! My daughter started when she was three and her listening, communication, reading, writing and 
                social skills have improved significantly.  Ms. Amber is good at providing a fun learning environment full of activities for the kids.  My 
                daughter loves school and is always excited to do her homework.  I feel confident that my daughter will be well prepared and ready for 
                Kindergarten. <br/> <br/> Silvia V.

                I have been very impressed with Mrs. Amber’s KinderPrep Preschool this year. My son Jarom loves to attend preschool, and wishes that he 
                could go to preschool every day. The classroom is warm and inviting for the children, and stimulates learning. I appreciate the structure 
                and consistency of the class schedule, which balances the development of academic and social skills which are very important in kindergarten. 
                Letters, numbers, shapes and colors are taught in an organized fashion, and practiced through fun activities. I am very pleased with my son’s 
                grasp of the basic topics, as well as his handwriting, reading abilities, and simple math knowledge. Jarom has been challenged in preschool, 
                and homework has reinforced the in-class learning. I have also been very happy with my son’s social development in preschool. He has learned 
                how to play together with other children, solve problems, listen to the teacher, and follow directions. I love the art projects that my son 
                brings home each day, and the fun topics that the children learn about, like weather, dinosaurs, families, holidays, and the five senses. The 
                fieldtrips have been very enjoyable and enriching, and have given Jarom wonderful memories. I am confident that he will be academically and 
                socially ready for kindergarten next year. Jarom really feels like he belongs in his preschool class, and that he is an important part of the 
                group. I believe those feelings stem from great teaching and guiding in a loving atmosphere. Thank-you, Mrs. Amber!! <br/> <br/> Suzanne H.
